In the ``fermi``, the function ``get_detector_sun_angles_for_time`` returns the angle with respect to the Sun of each Fermi/GBM detector.
However, these files contain gaps due to the South Atlantic Anomaly.
If the time requested falls in one of these gaps, the code will return the detector angles for the next available time.
This can be several minutes different from the time requested.
Now, a warning to the user will be raised if the time returned by the code is more than 1 minute different from the time requested (1 minute is the nominal cadence of the spacecraft weekly file), and explains that this is likely due to a South Atlantic Anomaly encounter.
